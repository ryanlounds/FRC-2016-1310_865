<h2> 2016 Demo robot code for FRC 865's Kobayashi and FRC 1310's Scorpion</h2><br>
This repository contains the code for both 865 and 1310's 2016 robots that are programmed to use 1 remote for use at demonstrations.<br>
<h3>Deploying</h3>
The code for both robots is done in the original 2016 FRC Suite and is deployable through any version of Eclipse with the correct plugins, I personally recommend using Eclipse Mars with the 2016 FRC Plugins to have the exact same layout as one would in 2016. The links to Eclipse Mars and the 2016 FRC plugins can be found below.<br>
- <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/mars/">Eclipse Mars</a><br>
- <a href="http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/EclipsePluginsV2016.1.0.zip">2016 FRC Plugins</a><br>
For help installing the 2016 FRC Plugins locally (which you <u>will</u> have to do), you can follow the instructions <a href="https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/getting_started/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java#installing_the_development_plugins_option_2_download_and_install_offline">here</a><br>
<br>
<h3>Running</h3>
The 2016 FRC Suite is compatible with any newer version of FRC DriverStation that supports the RoboRIO.
<br>
<h3>Differences between the 2 repositories</h3>
The code for the 2 robots are very similar, almost identical even. <br>
The differences follow:<br>
-865's uses a Talon SRX for the flywheel, 1310's uses a Victor SP<br>
-1310's has 2 motors on the intake, 865's only has one<br>
