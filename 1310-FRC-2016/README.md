This is not the original production of code for either robot! 
This is a lightweight reproduction of 865's single remote code originally developed in 2016. This exact version of code now runs on both robots after I helped fix both robots. 
The minor changes that have to be made for each robot will be published at a later date. I may also just release the a version for 865's 2016 robot. (865 uses a Talon SRX on the flywheel, 1310 uses a Victor SP)


The original version of 865's code can be found here: https://github.com/Team865/FRC-2016
The original version of 1310's code can be found here: https://github.com/RunnymedeRobotics1310/2016_Robot
